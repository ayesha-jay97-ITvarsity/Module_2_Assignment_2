                            Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean 
                            without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later 
                            that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the 
                            governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a 
                            valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into 
                            the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies 
                            with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.
