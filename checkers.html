                        <p> Better and better; this is what we strive for on behalf of the 
                            millions of customers who’ve made Checkers a household name since 
                            1956. But what does it really mean to be “better and better”? 
                            Well, our track record for pushing boundaries can be traced back 
                            to the opening of our maiden store in Mayfair, Johannesburg. As 
                            it turned out, that first, humble 38 square metre outlet would 
                            become the incubator for many groundbreaking ideas for the then 
                            fledgling supermarket. 
                        </p>
 
                        <p> Today, backed by the biggest food retail group in Africa, we’re 
                            able to tap into a wealth of resources that further fuel our 
                            innovative spirit and drive to be better and better. The Shoprite 
                            Checkers family’s collective mission is to bring products and 
                            services to market that delight in both quality and price, and 
                            we’re able to do that thanks to a shared commitment to our customers.
